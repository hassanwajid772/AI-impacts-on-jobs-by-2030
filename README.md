🤖 Predicting Workforce Automation Risk by 2030A comprehensive machine learning project designed to categorize job roles into Low, Medium, or High Automation Risk by the year 2030, leveraging multi-dimensional skill features and AI exposure metrics.📌 OverviewWith the rapid rise of Generative AI, the labor market is evolving at an unprecedented speed. This project develops a supervised classification framework to help workforce planners, educators, and policy makers identify which occupations are most vulnerable to automation.Key Objectives:Predict automation risk levels for various job roles.Analyze the impact of 17+ features including AI_Exposure_Index and Automation_Probability.Compare different data-balancing techniques (SMOTE, Oversampling, Undersampling) to ensure model fairness.

📊 Dataset & FeaturesThe model is trained on a curated dataset of approximately 300 samples with high-granularity job descriptors:Target Variable: Risk_Category (High, Medium, Low).Core Features: * AI_Exposure_IndexAutomation_Probability_2030Tech_Growth_FactorAverage_Salary10+ Skill Dimensions (Technical, Soft Skills, etc.)🛠️ MethodologyThe project explores three distinct experimental setups to handle class imbalance:Oversampling: Replicating minority class samples.SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): Generating synthetic data points.Undersampling: Reducing majority class samples for a balanced view.
Models Evaluated:Logistic RegressionRandom Forest Classifier (🥇 Best Performer)Support Vector Machine (SVM)K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)Decision Trees🏆 Performance ResultsThe Random Forest Classifier consistently outperformed other models, particularly in the Oversampling experiment.ModelAccuracyF1-ScoreRandom Forest91%0.91Logistic Regression85%0.84SVM82%0.81Note: In specific undersampling tests, models like SVM and Random Forest achieved up to 100% accuracy on the test set, though the Oversampling model (91%) is recommended for broader generalization.📂 Repository StructureBash├── AI impact on jobs 2030 report.pdf       # Detailed research documentation
